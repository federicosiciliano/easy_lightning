Introduction
------------
Welcome to the Easy Lightning documentation. This site provides comprehensive guides and API references for building and configuring your Easy Lightning models.
Use the table of contents below to navigate through the modules and configuration settings.

EasyLightning is not limited to the specific datasets, models, or experimental setups presented in repository.

- New datasets can be integrated simply by converting them into the standardized format used by the framework.
- Models can be added easily as PyTorch nn.Module classes, with minimal configuration to define their inputs and outputs.
- The experimental setup is fully configurable via a YAML file, allowing users to explore custom scenarios beyond those covered here.
- The framework also supports further extensibility â€” including custom loss functions, optimizers, and more.


So far, we've developed EasyTorch and EasyRec. If you'd like to help us develop more modules or if you find any bugs, feel free to get in touch with us!
